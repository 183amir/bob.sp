      dtype
        Data type (eg. numpy.dtype object. Supported data types are uint8 and uint16

      quantization_method
        Possible values of this parameter: "uniform" (uniform quantization of the input signal within the range between min_level and max_level); "uniform_rounding" (uniform quantization of the input signal within the range between min_level and max_level, but similar to Matlab quantization (see http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/275291); "user_spec" (quantization according to user-specified quantization table of thresholds.)

      num_levels
        Number of quantization levels. The default is the total number of discreet values permitted by the dtype

      min_level
        Input values smaller than or equal to this value are scaled to this value prior to quantization. As a result, they will be scaled in the lowest qunatization level. The default is the minimum value permitted by dtpe "

      max_level
        Input values greater then this value are scaled to this value prior to quantization. As a result, they will be quantized in the highest quantization level. The default is the maximum value permitted by dtype.

      quantization_table
        1D numpy.ndarray containing user-specified thresholds of the quantization. If this parameter is given, quantization_method is automatically set to "user_spec". Otherwise, it is recalculated according to other quantization parameters. Each element corresponds to the lower boundary of the particular quantization level. Eg. array([ 0,  5, 10]) means quantization in 3 levels. Input values in the range [0,4] will be quantized to level 0, input values in the range[5,9] will be quantized to level 1 and input values in the range [10-max_level] will be quantized to level 2.
